# How to setup Visual Studio Code auto complete:

1- Open a folder in VSCode

2- Create a `jsconfig.json` file at the root of that folder.
That file indicates to VSCode that it is a JavaScript project.
Just put inside that file this content:

{
}

3- Create a `defs` folder and copy there the Phaser typescript definitions.
I just named it `defs` but you can use your own name.

4- Create a new `game.js` file and write some code there,
it should auto-complete the Phaser API.
